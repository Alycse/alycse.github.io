                        My name is Joshua Barcena.
                        I'm a 21 year old developer currently residing
                        in <span class="highlightPurple">Quezon City, Philippines</span>, and I recently
                        acquired a <span class="highlightBlue">bachelor's degree in Computer Science</span>
                        at <span class="highlightPurple">University of Santo Tomas</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a self-taught programmer and I've created multiple applications that I published online
                        (You may see them in my <span class="highlightBlue">PROJECTS</span> page!),
                        and have written programs and tools that have helped
                        make my life easier.
                    </p>
                        I like to think both logically and creatively, and I try to be very resourceful in achieving my goals, maximizing every resource available to me in order to solve a problem.
                        I am also very passionate about learning new technologies and doing stuff I've never done before (like this website, and a bunch of my other projects!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from software development, my interests and hobbies include playing the guitar, playing video games,
                        making my own music with FL Studio, and creating random devices with Arduinos.
                    </p>
